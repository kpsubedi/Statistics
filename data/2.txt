Hospira PCA Drug Infusion Pump Published on April May by tech The Hospira PCA Drug Infusion Pump suffers from a number of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities This device is literally the least secure IP enabled device I ve ever touched in my life I d like to shout out Billy XSSniper Riois for his previous work with MedNet featured in wired Before we continue it is important to note that the manufacturer has been notified of critical and serious design failures that result in an insecure design These pumps will not be re certified and Hospira has no plans of patching these devices UPDATE DHS has issued an alert here and have indicated the vendor is now working on a patch I would personally be very concerned if this devices was being attached to me It is not only susceptible to attack it is so poorly programmed it can be rendered a useless brick with a single typo thankfully I have two making recovery possible Note that this is a Life Critical Device deployed on a separate Life Critical Network in hospitals I will attempt to highlight the risk posed by this device by detailing one of many possible attack scenarios Scenario By default this device comes configured with an IP address of By attaching to the Ethernet port on the back and configuring your laptop or itty bitty embedded device attack tool you can easily extract the wireless encryption keys stored in plain text on the device An attacker with physical access eg any patient to this device can instantly recover the keys to the Life Critical Network Once attached wirelessly to the Life Critical Network an attacker has complete control of ALL drug pumps in the hospital Remote administration of the device can be accomplished over the network without credentials Even if credentials were implemented on the Telnet port there are still web services CGIs that allow a remote attacker to change the drug library update software and run commands Even if that web service was secure there are additional services like FTP that are open with hard coded accounts Lets take a look at the pump and the individual vulnerabilities Hospira PCA Drug Infusion Pump An unauthenticated remote root shell is attached to TCP PORT CVE This is a game over vulnerability that allows an attacker with physical access to the device complete control over their own device This becomes important as there are a number of additional critical information leakage vulnerabilities that allow a local attacker complete control over the Life Critical Network Hard coded local accounts These hard coded accounts were found stored on the device These were cracked in HashCat using bruteforce mode very quickly htpasswd file in ram mnt jffs config
Admin eVERxIMMaY
hospira OkEElj w nbsp Unsafe wireless key storage The WPA keys for the super secure hospital wireless network sit on these machines unencrypted and plain text They are stored in ram mnt jffs config and can be accessed over Telnet and FTP Since these pumps are designed to stay attached to patients local access needs to be considered These devices are configured to exist on a medical device network This also needs to be considered by hospitals selling their old equipment The web server is AppWeb server running v source code http appwebserver org software appweb linux x self tar gz that has its own CVEs already nbsp Exposed CGIs linkparams and xmmucgi do not require authentication and allow firmware updates command execution and drug library updates nbsp nbsp Additional Info cat hospira version apps cat proc version

Pump Post navigation More Articles Snarfing Segate HD Firmware from flash thoughts on ldquo Hospira PCA Drug Infusion Pump rdquo William Hyman May Could you clarify a couple of things You say the pump will not be re certified Who certified it in the fist place Who determined that this is a Life Critical Device What organization regulatory body uses this terminology Who has established the need for and designation of separate Life Critical Networks PS If someone has physical access they can do a lot more than hack it And if one were attached to you you probably have higher priority issues Reply tech May Thank you for the questions Are you Professor William A Hyman by chance http williamhyman com I see you have expertise in Medical Device Design and Medical Device System Safety and Human Factors Please feel free to share your expertise The FDA is responsible for pump approval and oversight For exampleOn May FDA medical device regulators put their highest risk Class I warning on a recall of infusion pumps made by Abbott and Hospira Am I incorrect in calling it a certification I am also under the impression that the FDA approves the device for sale If a clarification should be made to the original article please let me know I have read Life Critical Device and Life Critical Device Network in multiple vendor deployment guidelines This is typically used to describe a layer segment that hospital equipment is used on Typically these devices are deployed in a combined effort between the manufacturer and the hospital IT group I expect that if you ask anyone from a hospital IT group medical device deployment team or anyone that knows anything about security you would be told that there is a need for and designation of separate Life Critical Networks Think SCADA If you think these devices should sit on the same network as the receptionists PC we will have to agree to disagree PS This device is DESIGNED to be accessed physically by a patient It has an exposed Ethernet port that leaks the wireless credentials of the hospital The result is that a patient with physical access to one pump can attack all pumps A local physical attack could be carried out with a raspberry pi in less than seconds Reply David Harkness May If one were attached to you you probably have higher priority issues The scary problem isn t a patient messing with their own drug delivery though that could possibly be used to create legal issues The problem is that one patient can use their own device to compromise the drug delivery of all other patients on the same Life Critical Network from the comfort of their own bed Worse the attacker doesn t even need to be a patient Anyone with physical access to any of the devices in use or not on the network can perform the attack Pretend to be a visitor slip into some poor sap s room grab the wireless access keys in a few minutes using a laptop and walk out You can now remotely control all the devices on the network until the keys are changed which is probably never Reply ivor May Life critical network Running over wireless Enough to make my heart stop Reply William Hyman May Infusion pumps are cleared by the FDA not approved since such pumps are FDA Class II devices This clearance is done via a k Premarket Notification The word certified is not applicable Once cleared they remain cleared and legally marketable unless the manufacturer proposes to make a change deemed significant enough to warrant a new or Special k Recalls are overwhelmingly initiated by manufacturers FDA then categorizes the recall A recall does not necessarily rescind a clearance depending on what needs to be done to fix the problem causing the recall I will leave it to network people to respond to and although the involvement of the manufacturer in deployment and the nature of the network configuration is no doubt dependent on the nature of the device The patient is accessing the pump through a wired push button pendant They are not doing anything with the pump itself or with the Ether port There has been a trend for cyber security risk identifiers to think that they deal with the biggest highest priority risks and in turn to think that their issues require immediate attention Some better balance and measured judgment is required Reply tech May If there is importance in the distinction between cleared and approved I m missing it I get that you don t like the term certification because it suggests the FDA has a specific set of criteria it checks for before issuing a certificate The Hospira spokeswoman from the wired article however says The LifeCare PCA device is not being re certified by the FDA so you ll forgive me for borrowing from the direct quite from the manufacturer Leaving the questions of the network with the network guys is precisely how we got into the boat we re in now The patient accesses the pump through a pendant that is connected to the pump Follow the pendant to the pump and beside it you ll see an Ethernet port Saying that people with physical access to a device use the pendant for an interface is like saying people can only use a webpage through a browser Do you NOT feel this is a big risk that requires immediate attention I am interested in how you feel this could be better approached and what additional judgment was required in this case Reply robert May W Hyman If this is not the most critical risk of the pumps at the moment Iwould be even more worried if I were a hospital By any chance are you responsible for the other design then please reveal what worse game over risks exist with this product Do you really understand what the author wrote Reply robert May The result is that a patient with physical access to one pump can attack all pumps A local physical attack could be carried out with a raspberry pi in less than seconds Maybe you should be clear that anybody visitors any kind of personell patients who can access a pump for some second in use or stored anywhere in the hospital can manipulate any pump of the hospital with the use of a thumb drive sized device Reply William Hyman May The difference between cleared and approved is the degree of scrutiny given the device before it is marketed Approved involves lots of scrutiny and usually a clinical trial Cleared is little scrutiny and rarely a clinical trial If people understood this better they wouldn t be shocked when cleared devices turn out to be problematical and they then discover that those devices were never the subject of a formal clinical trial I don t like the word certified in this context because it has no meaning It isn t helpful to use language that is not recognized in the medical device world let alone to question why a technical person trying to communicate technical issues would want to use erroneous language The Wired quote of Hospira saying it isn t being recertified is in response to an assertion that it was In this regard Hospira might have added because there is no such thing I learned that risk is a function of probability and severity eg as in ISO Risk in the real world where resources are limited and priorities are necessary is not any bad thing that could conceivably theoretically happen If you look in for example the FDA s MAUDE data base or read any infusion pump literature you will see lots of examples of real and ongoing risks with these devices none of which involve hacking I have no proprietary involvement with any infusion pump designs if that is what Robert asked Reply tech May Scrutiny Approved lots Cleared little
This device none Let s be clear Unless you re referring to QA controls does this stay powered on when I turn it on does this tube get pinched a device that has a root shell exposed with no password has not received any level of scrutiny Hospira might have also added because we don t care about security We are better than this William I think that people are shocked to discover the incredibly low standards put on these devices They are shocked by how a critical industry has moved so incredibly slowly for so long Let s do better Reply William Hyman May Of course this device went through the FDA clearance process so no scrutiny is clearly not correct You might say inadequate scrutiny from your perspective with respect to your favorite risk But risk fetishes do not equal risk importance Reply logan May Spoken like a true academic WIlliam Reply David Harkness May If I m going to have my taxes used to decrease my security and privacy via the NSA and FBI under the assumption that terrorists will stop at nothing to sow fear and kill civilians including becoming increasingly more tech savvy it behooves us to ensure corporations are employing at least minimal precautions to make it harder to implement those attacks I m content to spend my taxes on police to track down your stolen car but don t park it on the street with the keys in it and the window down Reply William Hyman May Is that good or bad Reply logan May Given that apparently I am now classed as a risk feitshest then to me your viewpoint of this device went through the FDA clearance process so it is fine whats the fuss is a bit naive
Yes it is approved to do it s function of providing pain relief by the FDA and does it carry that out successfully yes did the FDA do its job there yes But To say But risk fetishes do not equal risk importance is irresponsible If all of these devices have ethernet enabled in the default config then anyone with access to it could potentially carry out this attack using common off the shelf equipment and this could effect every one of these devices on that network across the entire healthcare facility not a singular device an entire network this isn t even going into other potential attacks where this flaw is utilised to gain access to the wireless network itself and who knows what damage that could do If it was me I would be advising the FDA to include security reviews by independent third parties of hardware software in order to fix the gap in the approval process Not saying oh the FDA approved it it is fine Reply anon May Dear Mr Hyman what this vulnerability means is that you could overdose kill people remotely without leaving any traces It s worth a patch I understand that there are other things like could the power supply break medication leak etc and when it only came to the root shell via ethernet I d agree with you But these devices are wirelessly networked and that makes it inacceptable Sincerely anon Reply William Hyman May I never said clearance not approval was fine or adequate The k process has been much criticized And the FDA has upgraded its cybersecurity requirements via Guidances and Draft Guidances Do you get a discount on if s and could s let alone who knows what else Reply NKT May William You are being somewhat disingenuous Whilst there are risks out there that could be considered bigger if you understood what was being described above you would realise that there are not many Kill a few hundred people This device would let you do that I have no idea what the numbers of these in use are but even just one in a hospital would allow a simple attack on the entire hospital network Certain death to anyone connected to one of these pumps and at the least bad a Denial of Service attack against the rest of the network At worst the software on the pump could be re written as whatever an attacker wanted Anyone wanting to cause terror could attack a hospital or any other wireless network quite effectively from the car park or a few streets away or if they can find a gateway such as a modem or internet connection they can attack from anywhere in the world An open root shell is the most open of open gateways In physical security terms this is worse than hanging the key on a leg on the door this is there is no door on the main entrance The only protection is a sign pointing to another door saying Entrance this way Reply Ivor May Oh William Oh poor sweet William Imagine an undocumented feature in a certain manufacturer s cleared approved automobile which causes the wheels to fall off resulting in the certain death of everyone inside This undocumented feature can be triggered by anyone who cares to do so and only requires them to have had access to one sample car They can make the wheels fall off remotely Without fear of being caught While simply sitting by the side of the road drinking a cup of coffee Do you shrug your shoulders and say but the risk of this happening to any one specific person is very low or why would anyone do such a thing Or do you force a recall of these shamefully designed vehicles and chastise the manufacturer appropriately I find that the excuse risk is a function of x y and I don t think it s very likely is most often used by people who don t really have a full understanding of the risk the ease of realising the risk or the impact of that risk being realised And yes as someone who makes a living by demonstrating how to make such risks happen I find there is great mileage in could might be able to and possibly can After making your wheels fall off I could steal your wallet Then I might be able to go to your home and do horrible horrible things to your pets While I m there I possibly can eat all your cookies All it takes is a little imagination William Reply William Hyman May Imagination as in imaginary Reply Andreas Duffner May Hello could you just please remove all messages from and to William Hyman They make no sense at all Any visitor or bored patient in a hospital can kill patients without a trace and
these messages are about the deeper meaning of cleareance and approval Are you all silly Reply tech May I think his comments shine a light on the mind set of those responsible for medical device security now While frustrating to read I still feel it is valuable to attempt to understand where he is coming from Real security people and device manufacturers need to come together and security people have just as much to learn about medical device operation requirements as manufacturers do about security To be honest device manufacturers don t have it easy Something simple like patching is a nightmare to manufacturers Once a device is scrolls down to check term CLEARED it can not be modified without getting cleared again What happens if a patch ends up killing someone who gets sued I m not making excuses for vendors but I will try to understand their challenges so we can all solve them together Reply Stefan P May According to the manual the pump requires a local user interaction to the pumps touchscreen to confirm changes made through the network remote administration tools Can a remote attacker override this security mechanism and make the changes permanent without local user interaction or not I guess it is quite important to clarify this to estimate the malignity risk and impact of such an attack Thank you in advance Stefan Reply tech May I ve been able to execute arbitrary binaries on the root account You can directly modify memory with existing utilities on the pump While the device should ask for user confirmation of changes I highly doubt it was implemented properly I ll try to have it serving shots of tequila at Defcon Reply Stefan P May Thanks for the info happy hacking Reply witness digital May Gee William and you wonder why security folk tend to look down on academics such as yourself RISK is RISK ie ethernet port on a PCA hooked up to me wiresharked instantly if not sooner now i gain hospital wifi credentials as low hanging fruit without having to attack the wifi evidently you have not comedown from that tower to realize ANY low hanging fruit like this
WILL be exploited no matter what personal comments attack you make on folk for showing the emperor is unclothed ie risk fetishist comments aside I am from the other side I LOVE open holes like this and folk like you making light of the risk ensures this wont be given the attention it deserves and makes my job of penetrating such facilities for pay easier as prolly WONT get patched Thanx poe alert someone Reply William Hyman May Perhaps now you know why people who have to deal in the real world of real risks of a wide variety look down on cyber threat self proclaimed gurus who use their imagination to describe unrealized threats while ignoring what it is about things like infusion pumps that actually hurt actual people But now I have fallen into your game of personal attack Reply David Harkness May So we must wait for an attacker exploit a proven security hole before we address it Why then don t we wait for people to die before recalling a vehicle with a defective part Your reactive stance on product safety is irresponsible at best Reply D Lillie May At one point the Heartbleed exploit was an unrealized threat and even that was far harder to take advantage of compared to this You re a shortsighted idiot Reply William Hyman May Ahh some schoolyard name calling Reply Anon Academic May As an academic in the area of security research I d like to request that you don t consider this person representative of academia in general We re not all mentally deficient I swear Reply William Hyman May Noting that Anon Academic doesn t actually identify him herself Reply Ryan Giobbi May Interesting read but I don t think these are as insecure as claimed compared to other devices they appear to be about as locked down as most similar devices with an interoperability connection using HL Reply Dave Marsh May I have a number of years experience in the implantable active medical device industry working on implantable drug pumps blood glucose sensors and various neurostimulation devices first in software and system engineering and now in IT We take a risk based approach to engineering such devices and prioritize design decisions by assessing safety risks and their probability of occurrence and or severity While the risk of malicious exploitation of a security vulnerability is probably quite low it is more than balanced by the potential severity and adverse impact to the patients leaving aside the very large additional risk to the connected network and other like devices If any member of an engineering team in the companies where I have worked had even proposed this level of security they would have been summarily fired for incompetence Some companies hopefully many take security of their medical devices seriously It is apparent to those of us in the industry that FDA is increasingly looking at device security and hacking risk concentrating first on the riskiest devices They move slowly however and their priority is to concentrate on direct device safety issues rather than secondary problems such as malicious hacking risk They have issued guidance documents that reflect that they are beginning to change that viewpoint to a degree but they have a LONG way to go to properly address these problems Clearly the engineering team for the Hospira pumps never even considered network security or the safety of the connected network environment in any way Since the current regulatory framework is clearly deficient in protecting against such poor design I hope that analysis and public exposure of these flaws will drive companies to prioritize changes Thanks for shining a light on this example BTW this type of IV pump with patient controlled administration is typically loaded with opioid pain medication a deliberate overdose induced by a malicious hacker would almost certainly kill the patient With the level of access shown in the analysis above it could be easily accomplished remotely with only a very little additional reverse engineering Shameful Reply SP May I think something that s being overlooked in the debate about scrutiny from the FDA is the fact that the FDA does not actually test medical devices submitted for clearance It s not as if a heart valve implant comes in for clearance a review committee is formed and the result is Well Bob you drew the short straw this time you re going to have to live with this implant and see if you make it to our next meeting If so we ll clear it Clearance is completely based on the documentation submitted by the device manufacturer this is true whether the device is a hardware device a software device or both The documentation is expected to show that the requirements are well understood and that sufficient verification activities have been performed to minimize the risk of patient harm However anything not included in the documentation is tantamount to it not existing in the first place from the FDA s point of view which makes it very difficult to tell from the FDA s perspective whether something exists in the device and hasn t been sufficiently risk assessed or if something doesn t exist at all in which case how would you know to ask questions about it The FDA s role is to evaluate the documentation submitted and provide clearance or not based on that evaluation given this it isn t surprising that devices get clearance and have security holes because it is unlikely that the FDA itself will ever have the capacity to thoroughly understand the potential risks of any given system There is also no doubt that manufacturers will minimize or fail to disclose risks because of commercial pressures and there just aren t sufficient regulatory safeguards against that It s very easy for device manufacturers despite attempts to maintain high levels of quality through quality systems regulation such as CFR Part or ISO to rationalize a risk with yeah but nobody is actually going to try to telnet to this device In the software medical device world IEC specifies that the probability of all risks must be assumed to be which forces the focus onto severity without worrying about whether it might or might not happen but again if nobody documents that risk in a risk assessment and it never makes it into the documentation you re relying on the FDA to recognize the missing line item in a stack of paper that could be tens of thousands of pages high Things are going to get missed The required level of detail in the documentation certainly increases with the device classification from Class I to Class III Class III being the highest risk category but again the FDA doesn t physically test these devices it looks for evidence that risk has been minimized through adherence to standards such as the one William mentioned ISO The problem is that this is still an emerging space and the use of wireless networks remote firmware updates web and application servers as middleware etc are just not consistent enough that the regulatory agencies really know what questions to ask The FDA is also an insular community and thinks it knows everything it would do well to hire security researchers and even white hats from outside the medical world to offer a different perspective Reply WH May I have a question about the application of the probability assumption In the current discussion of a lethal drug overdose by a hacked infusion pump how would you reduce the severity without substantially limiting the utility of the device Would you have to make the reservoir so small that even if the drug was all delivered at once there would be no ill effect This would be akin to the idea of single dose packaging which is used for some manual drug administration But how would this work in an infusion pump Or would you have to stop using software control But this would effect probability not severity Reply tech May Some people have accused you of trolling and many visitors have passionately expressed their opinions but I want to reiterate my gratitude Your questions have sparked some discussion and have opened a dialog You talk of severity and probability and their roles in risk calculation You seem to feel that the probability of an attack at this layer level is near zero This is the reason for the security community outrage The question of how to reduce impact when a drug pump is hacked is a tough one It is an interesting question that focuses on the wrong part of the equation This research shows drug pumps have incredibly low bar for security The low security increases probability What we really need to see are steps to reduce probability By making the device more secure we can increase the technical expertise required to compromise the pump and thus reduce the probability We can reduce probability by reducing the attack surface and hardening the default configuration A device manufacturer could have had this thing audited by DEFCON Kids and they would have identified all of the vulnerabilities I ve reported Since this is a miniature nix system there is a wealth of existing knowledge about hardening That is a good place to start The quality of the code running the pump needs to be validated An external rd party needs to verify all custom code written for the device Code verification tools like Veracode are available A TRA Threat Risk Assessment needs to be performed on the device rd party libraries and software eg openssl busybox appweb etc need to be monitored and updated when security patches are released Someone within the device manufacturer organization needs to be held accountable for monitoring the feeds of all external rd party code These patches must be tested internally by device manufacturer engineers and developers I understand that changes to a device require paperwork I also understand that security patches that don t impact the design of the device do note require a new k Which brings us to firmware Here is an article on implementing secure firmware updates https www allegrosoft com wp content uploads Secure Firmware Updates Paper pdf
Firmware needs to be signed Trusted boot would be great The apple iPhone is a great model if you re trying to design a secure device Sure they are hacked every new release but it takes the most skilled in our community weeks or even months and requires dedication and often stacking multiple bugs If medical devices were as secure as iPhones we d be in a very good place Most importantly devices that don t need to be connected to the network shouldn t be Are the benefits of updating the drug library over wireless worth all of the above effort As far as general design and security goes sending is easier to implement than reading A wireless medical device that ONLY transmits would need to undergo much less testing If the major benefits of wireless communication can be achieved with broadcast style radio the attack surface can be reduced A device that only transmits would have a much smaller scope One thing that is very important for the security community to remember is the device manufacturer timeline The time between design and product availability can be many years and the security threat landscape is one that moves much faster than the current model can handle We need to improve the model For all the flack that PCI gets it sure would be nice to raise the security bar for medical devices to the one we use to protect our wallets I ll have to think for a while on your original question How could we reduce the severity of an attacker controlled pump Reply witness digital May Actually its an old and sad story with having to deal with the piled higher and deeper set you have no practical experience to speak of while the rest of us are out here disabling USB ports via superglue on office equipment because it IS attacked and you expect a open ethernet port on a device that dispenses opiatesPCA remember to NOT be hit by every addict Dont know what planet you were born on but its a problem those of us actually working in the field of IT have to address and is in fact addressed by several MUCH higher security devices to control dispensing of opiates in a hospital setting and this PCA leaves an open hole no matter WHAT your theories say it WILL be hit just as surely as the sun rises and again no guru here like YOU are claiming to be just someone working in the fields of IT Electronic design and CS since who has seen every LAST permutation of the risk arbitration you are attempting to parse with folks lives in the balance and again the fact that you can be trapped into this discussion shows that most of your argument is ego defending non facts sad to say
and again as someone who works BOTH sides of the street specifically with embedded linux systems thanx again for making my job easier as an intruder pays the bills someone Reply William Hyman May Name calling helps advance the discussion Reply witness digital May I will let my many compatriots who share my view here complete your ignominy as for moi I have seen enough Emperors new clothes again hint you really should find another profession you stink at this one someone
ps and yes identification of idiots bearing snakeoil is often accompanied by namecalling especially when ones relatives have been hooked to this exact device in the last months Reply William Hyman May Pays the bills might be what this is all about Reply Matt McKnew May First off guys Hello And secondly I agree with William about the name calling Let s just stop and get back to the main issues You know the important ones where people live or die you expect a open Ethernet port on a device that dispenses opiatesPCA remember to NOT be hit by every addict Actually yes We do not expect it Why Because it has never happened It goes into the device risk assessment matrix just like every other risk and comes out as a low mostly due to probability Now if tech savvy addicts who successfully admit themselves into a hospital paying all the associated fees and time commitments start hacking their infusion pumps for the express purpose of resetting their dose band maximum to the highest in the newly chosen library the probability might go up But it is not as likely as other scenarios such as a Nurse placing the wrong drug in the dispensary tube Which can be just as deadly And thus the development team will get more of the finite funding pool to develop a control fro that risk to bring it s level down I have never heard the terms Life Critical Device or Life Critical Networks Either in a HCP setting or in any manufacturing literature Can you give some more background on where you found these terms Billy The concept is very interesting to me and I kind of like the sound of them they appear to be about as locked down as most similar devices with an interoperability connection using HL This SO THIS Thanks for the context Ryan Reply Sebastian Freitag May I am a Software Architect for a company that provides Webservices for mobile devices and telematics solutions After reading this every user with some minimal IT experience would immediately realize that the flaws in this system are severe exploiting them so trivially easy and the consequences potentially fatal I would like to add that the posts in this discussion by William Hyman may be not from the Professor Hyman mentioned above Chances are that someone is trying to discredit the real William A Hyman Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published Required fields are marked Name Email Website You may use these HTML tags and attributes lt a href quot quot title quot quot gt lt abbr title quot quot gt lt acronym title quot quot gt lt b gt lt blockquote cite quot quot gt lt cite gt lt code gt lt del datetime quot quot gt lt em gt lt i gt lt q cite quot quot gt lt s gt lt strike gt lt strong gt Notify me of follow up comments by email Notify me of new posts by email Search for Recent Commentstech on Hospira PCA Drug Infusion PumpWH on Hospira PCA Drug Infusion PumpSebastian Freitag on Hospira PCA Drug Infusion PumpMatt McKnew on Hospira PCA Drug Infusion PumpWilliam Hyman on Hospira PCA Drug Infusion PumpArchives April March February Categories Firmware harddrive Reverse Engineering SCADA Uncategorized Meta Log in Entries RSS Comments RSS
