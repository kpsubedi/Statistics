April Catastrophic issues in security can occur but there are ways to recover Speaking at RSA Conference in San Francisco Bruce Schneier CTO of Resilient Systems highlighted the Sony Pictures attack as being an interesting case as it brings catastrophic risk uses to the fore and not catastrophic as in a life ending sense but in company terms He highlighted seven ways in which a catastrophic incident could be dealt with Firstly he recommended keeping it internal to quot incapsulate the catastrophic risk quot secondly consider that attackers on two axes of skills and focus and with someone who is low skilled but has a high focus would use a basic APT but in the case of Sony this was low skills and low targets quot Why this matters for security is the difference between absolute and low security it doesnt matter how good security is be more secure than the other guy and in a high skill high focus they want you quot he said quot The aAttackers wanted Sony and attackers have the advantage on internet and never fail not to get in and against a skilled adversary our defences don t work quot The third point was that Sony had bad security and a CISO who left before attack while the fourth that there is a democratisaton of tactics as we are not fighting a cyber war but we are seeing war like tactics used in cyber conflicts quot The blurring between nation state and non nation state is getting worse quot he said The fifth point was that attack attribution is hard and there is a broad distrust in the security community towards Government FBI quot Defence is difficult and who defends Sony if it was North Korea it is the military if it was hackers it is the police quot he said The sixth point is that incident response is difficult to figure out while the final and seventh is that resilience is hard too and you need to figure out how to survive and what may be the most cost effective strategy In terms of a solution Schneier said that the two options were more surveillance as you cannot have one person with all of the capability but that doesn t work while the second was more use control on copyright wars on D printers and software defined radio and computers and cars But two decades of education means it does not work so both fail Schneier concluded by recommending securing against technological threats and looking for defence points and the second is a more agile response quot In a lot of cases we respond fast enough and do ok but these are not disasters but we do need to do better quot he said quot There are a lot of problems so how do you determine what is worth it or not as you don t know what good enough security looks like It is not like a natural threat you can do maths on meteor strike so know what to spend on remediation but it doesn t mean we can do it as we are bad at this sort of risk quot How do we defend against that sort of attack which wants to do as much damage as possible It is not a question to worry about but think about Think about what they did and not who did it and decent response mdash you might be forced to be transparent and what would you do if it became public Just embarrassing or career limit embarrassing The goal is resilience in the face of attacks Just as I was saying since the s mdash it is about prevention detection and response quot Categories Articles Text Tags IT Security Guru larr What Bruce Schneier Learned from the Sony Breach Cloud Computing Trade Offs rarr Photo of Bruce Schneier by Per Ervland Schneier on Security is a personal website Opinions expressed are not necessarily those of Resilient Systems Inc About Bruce Schneier I ve been writing about security issues on my blog since and in my monthly newsletter since I write books articles and academic papers Currently I m the Chief Technology Officer of Resilient Systems a fellow at Harvard s Berkman Center and a board member of EFF Featured Essays It s Time to Break Up the NSA How the NSA Threatens National Security Terrorists May Use Google Earth but Fear is No Reason to Ban It In Praise of Security Theater The Eternal Value of Privacy Terrorists Don t Do Movie Plots more essays News Archives Archives by Date News Categories
