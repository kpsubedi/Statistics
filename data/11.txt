April Last year s massive cyberattack on Sony mdash presumed to have been a nation state attack orchestrated by North Korea mdash presents many of the most pressing issues of catastrophic risk says well known cryptologist and author Bruce Schneier chief security officer at security company Resilient In a talk at the RSA security conference in San Francisco Schneier considered the timeline of the attack and the response to it During the event hackers penetrated Sony s network stole data and then embarrassed the company by slowly releasing private emails from executives salary details copies of unreleased films and other sensitive information The hack which occurred over several weeks in November and December is believed to have been done in response to the studio s release of the Seth Rogen comedy The Interview with a plot that revolves around a plan to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong un The attack started in November with a spear phishing attack mdash a targeted email scam used to get access to confidential information Schneier said details of the attack were still not known but the hackers quickly obtained administrator credentials and penetrated the company s network Once they were in and downloading data a skull and crossbones appeared on the screen of a compromised computer quot This is where the hackers made a mistake because if you re going to penetrate a network and download data mdash put the picture up after you download the data quot he says Sony employees saw the image and quickly pulled the plug on the computer stopping the data transfer Interestingly he notes the US intelligence community quot realised right away this was a big deal quot and started to examine evidence from the hack on the same day This he says likely indicates the state had additional information pointing towards an action that went beyond a typical hack Then the data releases began In late November the hackers who called themselves the Guardians of Peace uploaded four previously unreleased movies on BitTorrent Four more major leaks occurred at the start of December These included quot Sony executives griping about stars and insulting the US president quot The NBC television network in the US stated that the hack pointed to North Korea mdash the hackers had also referred to the still unreleased film The Interview mdash but the FBI replied that it had no reason to believe North Korea was involved In mid December the Guardians of Peace made threats to attack theatres showing the film quot The FBI then makes a statement concluding the North Korean government is responsible quot says Schneier quot Now attribution is a big deal in the US We rarely do it And the president makes a statement quot But he said quot really nobody believes them It s amazing The FBI and the US president get up and say we believe it s North Korea and we say we don t believe it quot There are many reasons why he says For one quot Sony is a company hackers have loved to hate quot But the FBI reiterated that North Korea was behind the attack noting the hackers had at times been sloppy and logged on from North Korean IP addresses Yet this statement was still met with scepticism Schneier says All of this quot encapsulates a lot of issues of catastrophic risk that I m currently thinking about quot he says quot First the rhetoric of fear is real and it s scary quot Newt Gingrich called the attacks quot pure cyberwarfare quot while Senator John McCain said they were a manifestation of a new type of warfare quot There was lots of hyperbole and this really skews debates We re suddenly talking about war not hacking quot Second this type of attack presents a threat to everybody he notes It was both focused and highly skilled quot Against an adequately skilled adequately funded adversary our defences don t work period quot Third Schneier says quot Sony had really lousy security quot The company s chief security officer quot had left a few months before this attack because he just gave up trying to do good quot One document indicated the company was primarily focused on putting in the minimum it needed to meet legal requirements but says Schneier quot you ve got to do more than that quot Fourth quot what s happening is we re increasingly seeing warlike tactics used in broader cyberattacks It gives capabilities to people who didn t have capability before quot Today s sophisticated NSA programmes become tomorrow s PhD theses and the next day s hacker tools he notes Also perpetrators all have access to the same tactics and the same malware So you end up with quot a legitimate discussion on whether the Sony attack was done by a couple of guys or a nation state with a billion budget Now that is a weird debate to have quot Finally he says quot attack attribution is hard Packets don t come with return addresses and it s really easy for an attack to seem to come from somewhere else quot Providing evidence is also tricky quot I mean the US attributed this attack to North Korea and we don t believe them quot Uncertainty of attribution means it is harder to determine who exactly provides defence to the organisation under attack quot The legal framework depends on who s attacking you and why but in this case the two things you don t know is who s attacking and why quot In other words Schneier says quot whose job is it to defend Sony before we know whose job it is to defend Sony quot For example executives quot very quickly shifted from we are protecting our company to we are protecting our own careers It was chaos they really didn t know what to do quot If it s impossible to prevent this sort of attack we have to then learn how to deal with them he says quot Figuring out how to thrive despite them may be the best More of a transparency mindset might be valuable Don t care if your salaries are published quot But to take the issue further Schneier says he wanted to look at ways of dealing with quot truly catastrophic risk quot mdash say a cyberattack on a nuclear facility mdash quot and with existential risks quot More technology means more potential for damage because it makes for greater efficiencies This in turn encourages authorities to argue for mass surveillance on the basis that quot we cannot even have one person who might make a nuclear bomb quot Schneier notes quot The problem with that is it doesn t work quot Surveillance might work to uncover a conspiracy between a number people to do something but not for the acts of an individual because a single person is too unpredictable Another temptation is to introduce greater control on technology users Schneier expects to see attempts to restrict what people can do with computers or D printers for example But again he says quot It doesn t work You can stop some of the people some of the time but it won t work quot So what do we do Secure against the actual physical threats as much as possible he says and also aim for more agile response Respond fast enough and people can at least mitigate if not prevent disaster The difficulty he says is that quot we don t know what good enough security looks like And that raises a fundamental question will any of this work quot My question very broadly asked is have I just described a fundamental limitation on the evolution of intelligence and technology That it s physically impossible for a civilisation to get over that critical problem quot Categories Articles Tags The Irish Times larr Identifying Perpetrators of Cyberattacks Getting Tougher Bruce Schneier s Data and Goliath mdash
