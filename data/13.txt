April Security expert Bruce Schneier has looked at and written about difficulties the Internet of Things presents such as the fact that the quot things quot are by and large insecure and enable unwanted surveillance mdash and concludes that it s a problem that s going to get worse before it gets better After a recent briefing with him at Resilient Systems headquarters in Cambridge Mass where he is CTO he answered a few questions about the IoT and what corporate security executives ought to be doing about it right now Here s a transcript of the exchange What should enterprises worry about when it comes to the Internet of things Everything What practical steps should a CSO CISO take now anticipating there will be this IoT to deal with There s nothing you can do This is very much like the computer field in the s No one s paying any attention to security no one s doing updates no one knows anything it s all really really bad and it s going to come crashing down And it will be worse because these are going to be low margin devices low cost devices You update your computer and phone every three to five years You update your thermostat approximately never Home routers today Do you know the way you patch your home router You throw it away and buy a new one And that is going to be a freakin disaster This is a tough one It s like the computer ecosystem in the mid s but without things like the profit margin Companies will make quot the thing quot and they just put it out there and then they make the next thing There s nobody left on staff to do updates who knows how it works It s not like your OS So when you look at the cars the thermostats the refrigerators mdash it s going to be bad Home routers is where we re seeing it right now Low cost binary blobs no one knows how they work there s no one to update them lots of vulnerabilities and we re just stuck with it Look at routers When you see where routers are you ll see where everyone else is going It s not good Is there a way to predict what the likely problems will be that the CIO CISO will face Yes They will all happen all the time I can with certainty predict the problems There will be vulnerabilities they ll be exploited by bad guys and there will be no way to patch them So then you re talking about rip and replace with hopefully better secured replacements Hopefully but unlikely better Do I really have to worry about thermostats if I m a CISO It depends We are starting to see these devices used as attack vectors The Target breach happened through a point of sale terminal If your thermostat s on your network that could be the entry point The problem with the Internet of Things is attaching it to non things The Internet of Things is attached to your IT infrastructure so it s going to be pretty serious Is it at all analogous to BYOD in terms of policy where if you re a corporate security executive you just say we re not going to attach any Internet of Things devices to our network You could but that s like saying quot No we re not going to let our employees bring in their own lunch quot You can say it but it won t stick But they still say you can t bring in your own Wi Fi router and that sticks Wi Fi s different They no longer say you can t bring in your own tablet People would just quit I think you ll have a hard time enforcing any of those rules because IoT is so powerful If the CEO says quot We re saving of our energy bill quot and the security guy says quot But it s insecure quot the CEO will say quot Shut up We re saving on our energy bill Go away quot And it s going to be like that Are you saying people pretty much haven t learned anything from the earlier example of early insecure computers So it s a different industry This industry has learned from that industry It s the embedded people Some are trying The problem is going to be these are low margin low cost low quality devices That s what s going to kill us When you re selling a computer you ve at least got a support staff When you re selling a cent thermostat potentiometer pressure detecting sidewalk square smart light bulb mdash no one s going to be left to care about security Ultimately will there be better security in these devices Yes it will improve We will solve this This will not be the thing that kills our society But it s going to be a hard problem And it s going to be solved by weird stuff like there ll be security within the network because the endpoints are all crap Categories Text Written Interviews Tags Network World larr Schneier Turn Data Over to Those With Greatest Data Security
